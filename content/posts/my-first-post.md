Hello there.
My name is Moaad Elhammouti, Iâ€™m born and rise in Morocco, I speak Rifain, English, French, and Arabic, I have a University diploma taken after 2 years in marketing and international economic relationships.
So on 01/10/2019, my older brother introduced me to this amazing world called programming, I felt in love with it since then.
Learning to code has stunning cognitive-related benefits, such as problem-solving, computational thinking, analytical thinking, creative thinking, leadership-related skills, and even teamwork.
I'm also an athletic guy, I adore sports and I do love positive people (if you are one of them Welcome )
On this website, I will share with yâ€™all my humble knowledge about programming in general.
stay tuned to hear more about my journey :)
