Hello there .
My name is Moaad Elhammouti, iâ€™m born and rise in Morocco, I speak Rifain, English, French and Arabic, i have University diploma taken after 2 years in marketing and the international economic relationships .
So in 01/10/2019 my older brother introduced me to this amazing world called programming, i felt in love with it since then.
Learning coding has stunning cognitive-related benefits, such as problem-solving, computational thinking, analytical thinking, creative thinking, leadership-related skills, and even teamwork.
Im also an athletic guy, i adore sports and i do love positive people (if you are one of there Welcome )
In this website i will share with yâ€™all my humble knowledge about programming in general.
