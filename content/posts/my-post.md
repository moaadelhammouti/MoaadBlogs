what is git and why is it so popular?

If you are an absolute beginner, or you don’t understand how git works. this post for you my friend.

git is the most popular version control system in the world(VCS), and a VCS captures the changes made to our code over time. we can take a look at our HISTORY and know who made these changes when and why!
without a VCS we have to constantly store copies of the entire project in various folders. and this may take so much time and effort, especially if multiple people are working on the same project.
so we can say that with the version control system we can track our project history and work together.
why git?
because it’s :
Free
Open Source
SuperFast
Scalable

So if you are looking for a job as a software developer git is one of the skills you should have in your resume.
