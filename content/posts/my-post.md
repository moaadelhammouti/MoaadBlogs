    What is git and why is it so popular ?

If you are an absolute beginner, or you don’t understand how git works. this post for you my friend.

git is the most popular version controls system is the world(VCS), and a VCS captures the changes made to our code overtime. we can take a look to our HISTORY and know who made this changes when and why !
without a VCS we have to constantly store copies of the entire project in various folders. and this may take so much time and effort, specially if multiple people are working in the same project.
so we can say that with the version control system we can track our project history and work together.
why git ?
because it’s :

- Free
- Open Source
- Super fast
- Scalable

So if you are looking for a job as a software developer git is one of the skills you should have in your resume.
